# hello-world
Just another repository

This is just for trying out and exploring GitHub, which somehow I haven't been working with so far. Nevertheless, as I get more and more exposure to content on GitHub, this looks like a great place to put some stuff, that I want to use for my demos and little projects I am working on.

The only thing, that I am a bit unsure about is, why I need to pay for private space... or to but it different -  who will have an interest in my public spaces... Probably I am not uploading anything really private here anyhow...
